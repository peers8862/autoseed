# autoseed
New Linux installations based on existing and custom system configurations. 

This tool helps its users determine the setup of a new Linux operating system. The output ('Setup Summary') is shaped by numerous factors such as user preferences, current Linux architectures and prescribed processes, as well as hardware limitations and performance needs. Autoseed is intended to be a guide in the traditional sense of the term; it is focused on getting you to your destination while always being willing to narrate and create understanding. Assets included in the Setup Summary can include files like 'preseed.cfg' which most Linux installers accept during system setup.
